      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The year is 1850. The Latter-day Saints have now lived in the
        Salt Lake Valley for 3 years. The Latter-day Saint prophet Brigham
        Young saw that among the children being born and the immigrant
        converts coming to the area that it was difficult for them to
        learn the English language. He sought language reform in the form
        of a consistent phonetic alphabet which he called the Deseret
        Alphabet. We are here to teach about this lesser-known aspect of
        the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in
        game form! Website users will learn about the history of the
        alphabet, learn the alphabet itself, and be able to compete with
        one another via a scoreboard. 𐐐𐐲𐑉𐐪 𐑁𐐫𐑉 𐐆𐑆𐑉𐐨𐐲𐑊!
