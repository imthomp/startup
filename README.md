<p> <b>02/22/23</b>I learned about employing bootstrap in our startup project. Through some bumps and scrapes, we were able to figure some things out and make a nice looking site! I am excited to see what other features we will use.

## MEG:
<p> <b>02/16/23</b>I learned the importance of flexibility in changing previous plans. I also learned the importance of creating visuals in helping to streamline and improve your coding process. The great thing about HTML is how easy it is to change things around and create the skeleton of what you want your work to be. This skeleton is also helpful for visualizing and implementing better code and design. </p>
