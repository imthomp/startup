## ISAAC:
<p> <b>02/16/23</b>I learned about how we can put our ideas more into practice in our HTML. I am now a table master! </p>

<p> <b>02/21/23</b>I learned how we can use bootstrap well in the Simon project. It is a neat package of CSS.</p>

<p> <b>02/22/23</b>I learned about employing bootstrap in our startup project. Through some bumps and scrapes, we were able to figure some things out and make a nice looking site! I am excited to see what other features we will use.
</p>

<p> <b>03/01/23</b>I learned about JavaScript and how it is used to play the Simon game. I will definitely be looking back at that code as we work on our startup applicatino.

<p> <b>02/16/23</b>I learned the importance of flexibility in changing previous plans. I also learned the importance of creating visuals in helping to streamline and improve your coding process. The great thing about HTML is how easy it is to change things around and create the skeleton of what you want your work to be. This skeleton is also helpful for visualizing and implementing better code and design. </p>

<p> <b>02/22/23</b> I learned that Bootstrap has a lot of attributes that make it difficult to customize with CSS if you don't know exactly what you are doing. Specifically, the navbar is very picky. Div's are my best friend when it comes to creating visually appealing sites. </p>

<p><b>03/06/23</b> There is a lot of complexity when you start adding tables willy nilly to your website. It is really important to keep track of all the elements that you have in your HTML. Pseudo code is really helpful to figure out what actually is happening. Talking out what your code is actually doing is super helpful to debug.</p>
