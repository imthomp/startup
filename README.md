## ISAAC:
<p> <b>02/16/23</b>I learned about how we can put our ideas more into practice in our HTML. I am now a table master! </p>

<p> <b>02/21/23</b>I learned how we can use bootstrap well in the Simon project. It is a neat package of CSS.</p>

<p> <b>02/22/23</b>I learned about employing bootstrap in our startup project. Through some bumps and scrapes, we were able to figure some things out and make a nice looking site! I am excited to see what other features we will use.
</p>

<p> <b>03/01/23</b>I learned about JavaScript and how it is used to play the Simon game. I will definitely be looking back at that code as we work on our startup application.
</p>

<p> <b>03/06/23</b>Wow, we're starting to get a better handle on JavaScript. We now have our game working! I liked learning about how to have HTML and JS interact.
</p>

<p> <b>03/22/23</b>This unit has been interesting! I knew at least surface-level things about the earlier concepts we have learned, but everything from this part is completely new to me! Now I understand how to use these service with Simon. The startup application is going to improve with this stuff for sure!
</p>

<p> <b>03/23/23</b>I learned how I can use a database for a startup web application. This will be good for the startup application because we have also made it a game!
</p>

<p> <b>03/27/23 pt. 1</b>I learned how I can use a database to keep usernames and passwords! This will be great for the startup application because now people can come back to beat their old high scores. This is a great and handy service.
</p>

<p> <b>03/27/23 pt. 2</b>WebSocket is a great feature for a game! It adds a fun competitive aspect. This will be great for the startup application. I have now learned how to employ WebSocket on a web application.
</p>

<p> <b>04/04/23</b>Heck yes! We've got the website all done now. It was actually kind of cool to add all the different services to our website. I think my favorite part to learn about was the database stuff. It has a lot more obvious applications. Node.js is a useful way to see how the tech is working locally. We didn't go too advanced with our webSocket usage but I can definitely see how that would be useful in a game setting. Neat stuff!
</p>

## MEG:
<p> <b>02/16/23</b>I learned the importance of flexibility in changing previous plans. I also learned the importance of creating visuals in helping to streamline and improve your coding process. The great thing about HTML is how easy it is to change things around and create the skeleton of what you want your work to be. This skeleton is also helpful for visualizing and implementing better code and design. </p>

<p> <b>02/22/23</b> I learned that Bootstrap has a lot of attributes that make it difficult to customize with CSS if you don't know exactly what you are doing. Specifically, the navbar is very picky. Div's are my best friend when it comes to creating visually appealing sites. </p>

<p><b>03/06/23</b> There is a lot of complexity when you start adding tables willy nilly to your website. It is really important to keep track of all the elements that you have in your HTML. Pseudo code is really helpful to figure out what actually is happening. Talking out what your code is actually doing is super helpful to debug.</p>

<p><b>04/04/23</b> When it comes to converting your app into a service, there are a few things to keep in mind. The database is one. To store in a MongoDB, you need to have the proper url: mongodb+srv://userName:password@hostname. You also can use fetch to call the endpoints of other servers through your service. Additionally, you need to store login information in your database. There is a lot more complexity to authentication services that we have represented in Simon and in our Startup project. With websockets it is important to make sure that your function calls are actually happening in order. Additionally, there are cases where you might need to use async to make sure that websockets will work correctly without refreshing to a different page.</p>

Look at promise functions

Look at arrow functions
	• Basically C/Python lambda function

JSON syntax
	• {"x":3}

Check .match function
	• i incase

Look at html tags in the instruction

Look at await & async
    await waits for fulfilled promise

    One important restriction for working with await is that you cannot call await unless it is called at the top level of the JavaScript, or is in a function that is defined with the async keyword. Applying the async keyword transforms the function so that it returns a promise that will resolve to the value that was previously returned by the function. Basically this turns any function into an asynchronous function, so that it can in turn make asynchronous requests.

    The async keyword declares that a function returns a promise. The await keyword wraps a call to the async function, blocks execution until the promise has resolved, and then returns the result of the promise.

    We can demonstrate await in action with the cow promise from above. If we log the output from invoking cow then we see that the return value is a promise. However, if we prefix the call to the function with the await keyword, execution will stop until the promise has resolved, at which point the result of the promise is returned instead of the actual promise object.

This can be demonstrated with a function that makes animal noises. Notice that the return value is a simple string.

Look at DOM

JavaScript objects

	• Sudo
