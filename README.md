The year is 1850. The Latter-day Saints have now lived in the Salt Lake Valley for 3 years. The Latter-day Saint prophet Brigham Young saw that among the children being born and the immigrant converts coming to the area that it was difficult for them to learn the English language. He sought language reform in the form of a consistent phonetic alphabet which he called the Deseret Alphabet. We are here to teach about this lesser-known aspect of the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in game form! Website users will learn about the history of the alphabet, learn the alphabet itself, and be able to compete with one another via a scoreboard. 𐐐𐐲𐑉𐐪 𐑁𐐫𐑉 𐐆𐑆𐑉𐐨𐐲𐑊!
